Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Common algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Hierarchical Clustering
3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through trial and error
   - Agent receives rewards/penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
Key Concepts:
- Training Data: Dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for prediction
- Labels: Output or target variable
- Model: Mathematical representation learned from data
- Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture patterns
Popular Libraries:
- scikit-learn: Traditional ML algorithms
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework
- PyTorch: Deep learning with dynamic computation
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting for structured data
Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
